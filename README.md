Simple web app for tracking control over multiple capture points by several teams. Works offline in the browser with no dependencies.

## Features

- Global match timer with start, pause, and resume controls.
- Individual timers for each capture point and per-team time tracking.
- Default teams: RESISTANCE (purple) and MILITIA (gold).
- Per-team last capture timestamps shown in military and 12-hour time.
- Export logs as CSV or plain text and import logs from CSV.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in any modern browser. Use the **Setup** panel to configure teams, capture points, and operator name or load one of the builtâ€‘in scenarios. Start the match and switch point owners as play progresses. All changes are logged with timestamps and can be downloaded as a `.txt` file via the *Download Log* button.

CSV export/import buttons allow saving or loading the log in spreadsheet-friendly format.

Match controls allow starting, pausing, resuming, ending, and resetting games. State is preserved in `localStorage` so reloading the page continues where you left off.
